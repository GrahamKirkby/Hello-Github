These are my notes about learning GitHub.
- Step 1: Create an account
- Step 2: Make a repository
- Step 3: Edit files
- Step 4: Edit and delete files

Fantastic work! Youâ€™ve successfully learned and practiced the essential features of GitHub, including:

Creating and managing repositories
Making commits and viewing history
Adding, editing, and deleting files
Branching, pull requests, and merging
Cleaning up branches
Inviting collaborators
You now have a solid foundation to build and collaborate on projects using GitHub!

If you ever want to learn moreâ€”like using GitHub Issues, project boards, actions (automation), or have any other questionsâ€”just come back and ask.
Happy coding, and congratulations on mastering the basics of GitHub! ðŸš€
